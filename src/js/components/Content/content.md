##Location

The ceremony and wedding will all take place at the The Boatshed on the Wellington waterfront.

There is no parking on site at the venue, but there should be some free weekend parking spots nearby and around the city (time restrictions may apply). 
Alternatively the train station is a 10min walk, and with ample bus stops nearby should you wish to arrive and depart via public transport

##Accommodation

If you wish to instead stay nearby, there are so many place to choose from. The venue is centerally located in Wellington city, with plenty of options to go with. We will update if we can foresee that there are any events on over the weekend, but we say book well in advance to get a good place for a good price.

##Registry

*You’re invited to our wedding, when we both say ‘I Do’
And as you know we’ve been ‘I do’-ing for at least a year or two!
We’ve been together many years, and have a lovely home,
There’s not that many items we don’t already own.
So if your thoughts were on a gift, your presence will suffice;
But if you really feel the need, donations to a honeymoon would be nice!
The choice is really up to you and we’d just like to say;
That most of all, we hope you come, enjoy, and have a lovely day!*

or 

*We’ve lived together for quite a while,
With all our pots and pans,
And as we don’t need homely gifts,
We have another plan!
We know it’s not traditional,
But it’s easier that’s for sure,
To have no wedding list at all,
Your attendance means much more!
For those of you who do insist,
We have a savings pot,
A small gift to add to this,
Would really mean a lot!*
