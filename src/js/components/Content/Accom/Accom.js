                There are an abundant amount of places to stay in the CBD, and
                within walking distance of the venue. We would recommend booked
                earlier rather than later. So far there are no major events
                scheduled for the same weekend, but if that changes -
                accommodation can get snapped up very quickly and become hard to
                find or expensive.
